This details how data was migrated after the major changes brought in by nayeforms.

What were the table Changes
-------------
student_info_student
    removed backlogs, yeardrops
    a new field called photo - which stores the path to the photo file.

student_info_personal
    added weakness and strengths instead of just strength

How was the new database prepared ?
-----------------------------------
    * Data was imported using INSERT INTO ... SELECT command from the original database on the server.
    * Since we had photos already stored in STORE/photos with the name of the file as the prn of the student,
	UPDATE student_info_student SET photo=CONCAT('STORE/photos/',prn,'.png');
    * The tables that were dropped are:
	ldap_login_user_group_backup
	ldap_login_user_backup
    * To support the UNICODE data being imported from original data, the following was done:
	ALTER TABLE `student_info_marks` CHANGE `uni` `uni` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL ;	
	ALTER TABLE `student_info_marks` CHANGE `course` `course` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL ;
	ALTER TABLE `student_info_extrafield` CHANGE `desc` `desc` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL ;
	ALTER TABLE `student_info_student` CHANGE `career_objective` `career_objective` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL ;
	ALTER TABLE `student_info_extrafield` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
	ALTER TABLE `student_info_student` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
	alter database laresumex collate utf8_bin character set utf8;
