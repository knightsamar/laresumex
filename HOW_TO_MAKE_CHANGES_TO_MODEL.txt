We are the people of South -- the people who change models using South.

Ok, plainspeak - any changes that you want to make to the models in LaResume-X requires you to manage them using South.
Why ? Well, go read the benefits of South(http://south.aeracode.org/) OR simply give a free wadapav treat to Samar ;)

How to do that ?

On your dev machine:
--------------------
1. Make SURE :
	a) you have South installed and 'south' as an app in your settings.py
	b) you have a table south_migrationhistory created in your database (if not run 'python manage.py syncdb')
	c) you have the initial migration done -- if not, run 'python manage.py migrate student_info --fake 0001'
2. Make changes to your models.
3. Run 'python manage.py schemamigration <app_name> --auto'
	This will create a migration for the change you made inside <app_name>/migrations.
4. Apply the migration to your database and see whether all's fine.
	'python manage.py migrate <app_name>'
5. Double check whether your data is ok and the change in the DB structure is actually desirable.
6. Checkin your migration inside mercurial.
7. Push the changes.

On the production/staging:
--------------------------
1. (Same as that for dev machine above)
2. Pull in your changes from the repository.
3. Take a backup of your database. HOWEVER STUPID THIS SEEMS, YOU S-H-O-U-L-D do it if on PRODUCTION. OKAY ?
4. Ensure you actually have taken a backup. Yes ? Good.
5. python manage.py migrate <app_name> 
6. Check your database and check whether changes were applied rightly. If not use the backup from step 3.
7. Remember that 7 is the most magical number according to Harry Potter books :P
