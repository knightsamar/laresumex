resume_format should be a SYMBOLIC LINK towards the DIRECTORY of resume format that we wanna use.
THAT DIRECTORY should contain a file called template.tex which is what is actually used by us.

WHATEVER dirctory we choose, should be also copied under /home/USER/texmf/tex directory -- to make it searchable. Copy the directory. Don't DIRECTLY copy the tex files inside it.

Needless to say, this thing to fully work requires the whole LaTeX (tetex packages) along with etoolbox and modernl packages in ubuntu. Don't know about others.

Symbolic links do NOT get preserved inside HG repositories
