This directory will store :
    1. Resumes - .tex, .html, .pdf
    2. Photos - of the candidates
All inside a PRN/ directory for each candidate.


This directory must be _recursively_ rwx by the user which is used to run the webserver, otherwise many things will fail.
eg. For apache on OpenSuSE 11.2

chown -vR www-run:www STORE/*
