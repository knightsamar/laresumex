BUGS
====
* When trying to directly go to your own Edit wala URL, when the form has NOT been filled, it display a list index out range error. Instead a proper redirection should happen.



TODOs
=====
* Facilitate some extra fields from the user which WILL NOT be displayed in the resume.
    * Has backlogs ? When ? Which semester ? -done
    * Is a Software Development optee or System Administration optee or other MBA-IT/BCA/BBA-IT Stream optee ?
    
* Process and store the Additional Sections data - Done with one Additional Section for now by Apoorva.

* Allow reordering of the Sections (...shouldn't this be in the generate resume's domain of functionality ?)

* When submitting an EDIT of an EXISTING resume, all the dates, month and year are reset to 1,1,1900...Fix this! -- DONE! By Samar

* Instead of Percentage, ask for Total Marks and Marks-out-of in the Marks section. -- HG --done

* Decide whether we want to store weaknesses and whether they will be shown in the resume by asking Ashwini Mam/HG or better give the user a choice.

* Write a noscript element. Don't allow this form to be displayed if JavaScript is not enabled. -- DONE! By Samar

* Correct all spelling mistakes in the form :P -done

* Write something like GMail's photo dimension selector for photo. -please

IDEAS
=====
* If possible, allow rich text boxes for all textareas and be sure we can render them in the resume some way..maybe convert from HTML to latex formatting -- because I would want some words bold in a description.
